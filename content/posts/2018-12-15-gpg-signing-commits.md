- when setting up gpg on a new machine, if you see this error: "Inappropriate ioctl for device", add this to the `.bashrc` (source: [gnupg2: gpg: public key decryption failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device Â· Issue #14737 Â· Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/14737)):
