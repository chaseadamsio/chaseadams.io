I've started learning Rust recently. This is a roundup of links, learnings and things I'm working on.

## Learning
- Cargo doesn't come with a "add" or "remove" command for packages by default, so you have to add that with the `cargo-edit` crate. [cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit). `cargo install cargo-edit` adds the `cargo add <crate>` command so that you can easily add crates to your project dependencies.
