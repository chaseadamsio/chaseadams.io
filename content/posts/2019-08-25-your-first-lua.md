**Objective**: To educate people on the value of learning basics of programming and that power it gives them with an easy (but weird) language

- What is Lua?
- What is Hammerspoon?
  - intro: what the heck is hammerspoon even?
  - how do I get started?
  - let's do a basic, trivial example (print some stuff to your screen)
    - maybe a good chance to write some lessons on lua basics?
    - how to research the hammerspoon API
    - the hotkey bind is the bread and butter of making it work
  - a step further, make it easy to maximize the current window
  - what about shifting the current window to the left or right half of the screen
  - homework:
    - do the same for top or bottom
    - extra credit: shift it to the 4 quadrants of your screen
  - next up: using it with alfred for automation
- Installing Hammerspoon
- First Lua example with Hammerspoon
