Taking full-length screenshots of a webpage is useful for client work, keeping historical references of a website or when you want to have a webpage round-up gallery to show sites that you've found around the web.

In the past, if you needed to do this, you likely did it incrementally and stitched it together or installed a separate extension in your browser (most had varying results).

Recently when I was doing some mobile web development and checking how my site looked for various devices with Chrome DevTools, I noticed that Chrome has a baked in way of taking a full length screenshot!

1. **Open DevTools.** In the application menu click **"View"**, then **"Develop"**, then **Developer Tools** (Alternatively you can save some clicks with cmd+option+i on a Mac). You should have a new pane that has tabs for "Elements", "Console", "Sources" and more and below that you will likely see the HTML of the page you're currently on.

1. **Toggle Device Toolbar.** In the top left corner of the new pane, click the second icon from the left for **"Toggle Device Toolbar"**. A new toolbar should open at the top of the browser's window with options to change the page to be emulate displaying different devices.

1. **Take The Screenshot.** In the new device toolbar, click the **"More Options"** button (3 vertical dots) in the far right corner and click **"Capture Full Size screenshot"**.

Now you can take full size screenshots with ease and natively in the browser!
