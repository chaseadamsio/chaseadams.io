What decisions took you time to sit on? What was it that gave you reservations about those decisions? What decisions were you able to say yes or no to right away? you made those decisions based on what you value. what things bothered you? what were some things that frustrated you or made you angry this week? Asking yourself this question, ask why did they bother you or anger you or frustrate you. The reason we get upset is because our *values—*the ones that we subconsciously use to set expectations—were violated.
