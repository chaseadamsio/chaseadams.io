## Development

Running [chaseadams.io](https://chaseadams.io) requires NodeJS and npm.

### Requirements

- [NodeJS ^10.1.0 (JavaScript runtime)](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Install NodeJS with NVM

I recommend using [`nvm` (node version manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install NodeJS and npm. You can find [instructions for installing `nvm` in the GitHub README.md](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install--update-script)

Once installed, you'll notice that there is an [`.nvmrc`](/.nvmrc) in this project. `nvm` will use this file to determine the version of NodeJS to use.

If you haven't installed the verison required in the `.nmvrc`, you can do so by run `nvm install` without the version while in this directory and it will install it. Then you can run `nvm use` and it will use the current version.

Once you've followed the instructions for cloning the project, you can run the following to install and use the correct `node` version:


### Getting Started

Clone the source from GitHub:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:chaseadamsio/chaseadams.io.git && cdchaseadams.io
```

Use the correct node version:

```shell
nvm install && nvm use
```

Note: _When changing into other project directories, run `nvm use` to use the required version for those projects._

Install the `node` dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Start the Eleventy development server & open `http://localhost:8080`:

```shell
npm run dev && open http://localhost:8080
```

Now you should be up and running!

## Tasks

- `dev` - run the Eleventy development server.
