# Working Titles
- Humans aren't made to be efficient. Try effectiveness instead.
- The #1 Thing an Organization Can Focus on to Flourish

# Purpose
Convince others that they should start thinking about the value of the things they do as "effective" instead of as "efficient", because effectiveness is the way we get the most out of life and do our best work.

# Outlining
- why am I talking about this in the first place?
  I have seen time and time again that organizations optimize for efficiency. Every time efficiency has become a goal in any level of the organization, I've seen this deflate morale, become a gameable system and worst of all: lead an organization to grind to a halt.
- define knowledge work
- What are efficiency and effectiveness?
  - why it matters
  - what is efficiency?
    the ratio of the useful work performed by a machine or in a process to the total energy expended or heat taken in.
  - what is effectiveness?
    the degree to which something is successful in producing a desired result; success.
- Give an example: an efficient runner vs an effective runner (maybe use a boat analogy instead?)
- Why do I think effectiveness is the better attribute to optimize for?
- How do you change to optimize for effectiveness?
  - determine a list of themes that you care about
	- examples: family, building something that matters, writing an article that helps other people grow, growing yourself
  - ask "what can I do today that will make that thing better?"
  - flesh out the high-level outcomes into concrete actions that can be done to work towards it
- How do you measure effectiveness?
  - by the nature of it, it's harder to measure and I believe trying to measure it is an anti-goal

# Writing

I believe I exist to be **effective**. I believe _you_ exist to be **effective**.

I hope _you_ believe _you_ exist to be **effective**.
