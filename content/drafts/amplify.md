# Amplify My Peers

Someone asked me recently "if you could have a super power, what would it be?"

The answer was fresh on my mind because I'd just finished a fiction series on superheroes.

The answer was: **By being in the presence of others, I could amplify their abilities.**

To me, the greatest super power is the power to be an amplifier for the powers that others already have.

What I found most interesting about amplification is that it doesn't require living in an alternate universe for it to be possible. All it takes is a little practice and a willingness to care about others.
