A new [feature came to Slack recently for adding a formatting keyboard to the input box](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-format-your-messages).

You can disable this by clicking the "Aa" button in the right corner of the input box.

Unfortunately, this doesn't disable the inline formatting (WYSIWIG).
