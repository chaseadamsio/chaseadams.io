If you want to get rid of bad habits, create friction to those habits so that they are less "easy" to do. Spend too much money online? Delete your saved credit cards and keep your wallet or purse far out of reach. Spend too much time surging social media? Delete your apps and only log on through an Incognito window for 10 minutes, then close the window.

Friction is what keeps us from doing things, add friction to the places that aren't congruent with the person you want to be so you can slowly align to that person.
