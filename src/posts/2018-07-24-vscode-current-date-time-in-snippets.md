Previously when generating new blog articles, adding dates to Markdown frontmatter was a manual step that required me to:

- Determine the date
- Convert what I read into the date format I use for frontmatter

As of [VS Code release 1.20](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_20#_more-snippet-variables), Snippets have access to the current date and time with one of the following variables:

- `CURRENT_YEAR`
- `CURRENT_YEAR_SHORT`
- `CURRENT_MONTH`
- `CURRENT_DATE`
- `CURRENT_HOUR`
- `CURRENT_MINUTE`
- `CURRENT_SECOND`

Now if I want a frontmatter "date" for Markdown for the current year, month and day (`YYYY-MM-DD`), I can add the following to my snippet:

```yaml
date: "\"$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE\""
```

Using the published date of this post, the expanded snippet produces:

```yaml
date: "2018-07-24"
```
