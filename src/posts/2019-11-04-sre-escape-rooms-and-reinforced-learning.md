At Webflow we've started practicing SRE escape rooms: an SRE escape room designer creates some form of chaos in our acceptance environment and a group of SREs get to figure out how to get acceptance back into a healthy state.

It's been a great way for us to reinforce what we know and learn to keep our systems healthy.

This article will address:

- A more in depth explanation of what an SRE escape room is (similar to what some teams call "game day")
- A few examples of what we've done
- What the science says about spaced repitition for learning
