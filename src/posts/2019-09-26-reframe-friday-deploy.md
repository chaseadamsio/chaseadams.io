The conversation about "should we deploy on a Friday?" has gone back and forth on if people should or shouldn't. What I'd like to do is reframe the conversation around asking the question, and make proposals for how to, "What's missing that makes my team unwilling to deploy on a Friday?", as well as to challenge the assumptions of why "Friday Deploy Locks" are more detrimental to Mondays than they would be to Fridays.

Maybe "Should we deploy on a Friday?" is the wrong question...maybe the question we should be asking is "what friction exists that keeps us from building systems that increase their user's safety?"

Are you're interested in me elaborating on this post? If so, let me know on [Twitter at chaseadamsio](https://twitter.com/chaseadamsio).
