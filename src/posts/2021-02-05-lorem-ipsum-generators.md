Lorem Ipsum is a fundamental tool for building things for the web, so here's a collection of them.

# [Bob Ross Ipsum](https://www.bobrosslipsum.com/)

[Ariel](https://twitter.com/ariel_n) stumbled over this after finding Khaled Ipsum and knew this was Lorem Ipsum was for me.

Sample: 

> Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Take your time. Speed will come later. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.
>
> Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. This piece of canvas is your world. Work that paint.

Sample: 

> You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough?
