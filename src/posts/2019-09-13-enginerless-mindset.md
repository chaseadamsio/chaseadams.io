I am not an Engineer or a Developer. I am a Practitioner of Effectiveness with a powerful toolset in the ability to think programmatically and write code.

A thread I'm pulling on in my personal life:

- I am not an engineer or developer
- I am a practitioner of effectiveness
- The ability to think/build programmatically opens doors to tie together the right tools for the job
