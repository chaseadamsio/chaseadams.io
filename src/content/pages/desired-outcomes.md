_This document is the end result of me sitting down to think about what the desired outcomes of me writing, building and maintaining [chaseadams.io](https://chaseadams.io)._

I want this to be a place where software engineers find an answer to a technical problem they have grappled with or a problem they don't have time to grapple with.

I want this to be a place where people from all walks of life (not only software engineers) find inspiration to think differently about how they see the world. The desired outcome is not that they to come to the same perspective I have, rather that by reading, they are spurred to think about and challenge their perspective.

I want this to be a place where people can experience me exploring new concepts, new technologies and new ideas.

I want this to be a place where people can find what I've been doing to grow in a way that they can have clear direction on how to do those things themselves.

I want this to be a place where people can learn about how to be an effective individual contributor.

I want this to be a place where people can find the real me.
